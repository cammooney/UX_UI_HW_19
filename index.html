                    <p> I am a Junior UX/UI Designer in the Salt Lake City, UT area. I enjoy the process of creating a visually stunning and user-centered design. I love being able to explore my creativity in my work and personal life, whether itâ€™s a new design project or a new oil paint series. As a former college athlete, I know what it takes to work as part of a team, and how to negotiate stressful or time consuming situations. I consider myself great at following instructions, a clear communicator, and a perfectionist. I am open to working remotely or relocating depending on the area. </p>
